- This Machine Learning Project aims to classify the severity of the impact road accidents make on traffic in the US.
- The number of records in the dataset is huge. Hence instead of using the tradiditonal Pandas dataframe I have used a Dask Dataframe for all operations.
- I have used a CatBoostClassifer to train the model and achieved a test accuracy of 85%
